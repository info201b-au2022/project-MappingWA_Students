# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|race_and_poverty.R| A R code file exploring and representing the relationship between racial groups and if they fall below the poverty line in the counties of Washington State.

# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ...
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them in the table above
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore,
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete this NOTE sections (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
