### RESEARCH QUESTION:
# How might food insecurity be related to studentsâ€™ socioeconomic status?

### CONSIDERATIONS:
# - median income
# - poverty line
# - percent with food insecurity
# - students under 18
# - number of students suffering from food insecurity by district
# - average median income across all counties
# - compiling average statistics on proportion food insecure students
#   per county
